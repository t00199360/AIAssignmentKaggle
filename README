Github sometimes does not render .ipynb files. If you experience this issue please try looking through this link: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/t00199360/AIAssignmentKaggle/blob/master/Spotify_artist_recommender.ipynb
An old repository had to be used. Not sure why but colab wouldnt save the file to a new repo
